Journal Entry: DIY Wireless Monitor Project

Date: October 25, 2025  
Project Status: Planning Phase Complete, Ready for Execution


Today I officially kicked off my DIY wireless monitor project, and honestly, I'm pretty excited about it! I spent the better part of the day figuring out exactly what I need to make this work.

What I Did Today:

First, I sat down and researched all the different ways to build a wireless monitor. There were a bunch of options—Raspberry Pi with VNC, Miracast, wireless HDMI kits, even USB DisplayLink adapters. After comparing them all, I decided to go with the wireless HDMI transmitter/receiver approach because it's the most beginner-friendly and doesn't require any coding or complicated software setup. Plus, the latency is way better for what I want to use it for.

Then I spent a few hours sketching out my build plan and identifying all the parts I need:

My Parts List:
- 15.6" IPS LCD panel (1920×1080, 30-pin eDP interface)
- eDP controller board kit with HDMI input
- Wireless HDMI transmitter/receiver kit (going for something with low latency)
- 12V 3A power supply
- HDMI cables and basic mounting hardware
- Anti-static wrist strap (learned this is super important for handling LCD panels!)

I've also mapped out the assembly process step-by-step, from connecting the delicate ribbon cable between the panel and controller board, to setting up the wireless system, to eventually building a simple enclosure. Watched a few YouTube tutorials on connecting LCD controller boards to make sure I understand how the ribbon cable connectors work—those flip-lock mechanisms look tricky but doable.

The Plan Moving Forward:

I'm ordering the LCD panel and controller board from Amazon this weekend. The wireless HDMI kit I'll grab from Amazon as well since it ships faster. While waiting for parts, I'm going to watch more assembly tutorials and set up my workspace properly—clearing off my desk, getting a cardboard work surface ready, making sure I have good lighting.

Budget-wise, I'm looking at around $200-220 total, which is way less than buying a commercial wireless monitor. I've broken down the costs for each component and even have backup options in case something doesn't work out.

Honestly? I'm a bit nervous about handling the LCD panel—apparently they're super fragile and static electricity can fry them permanently—but I've got a solid plan for staying safe. I'll ground myself properly, work carefully, and take my time. 

The best part is that once everything's connected, there's basically zero software configuration needed. The wireless HDMI is plug-and-play, so I just connect it and it should work. No drivers, no firmware, no coding. Perfect for someone like me who's never really done electronics projects before.

Next steps: place my orders tonight, gather my tools (screwdrivers, multimeter if I can borrow one), and keep watching tutorials while I wait for shipping. I'm giving myself about 4-5 hours of assembly time once parts arrive, probably spread over a weekend.

Let's see how this goes!

Key Takeaway: Planning is 80% of the work. Now that I know exactly what I need and how to put it together, the actual building should be straightforward. Fingers crossed!![brave_screenshot_www.amazon.in](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTM2MywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--49b7b0c6e832b5e84ce7fb666388d6037ff7bbc2/brave_screenshot_www.amazon.in.png)
  

## 10/25/2025 1 PM - ummm plan changed   

my plan to build a monitor from a bare LCD panel almost became an expensive disaster. After reading DIY threads, I learned panel/controller compatibility is a nightmare: resolution and refresh rate, eDP lane count (30 vs 40), voltages, and backlight connectors must all match. Get any of that wrong and you’ve got a costly paperweight. I also realized I was about to handle fragile ribbon cables and a ₹8,000 panel with zero experience or protection. Bad idea.

The better option I found : buy a complete portable monitor and use a Raspberry Pi as a local receiver. Stream from my laptop to the Pi over WiFi, Pi outputs HDMI to the monitor. It feels less like raw fabrication, but it teaches Raspberry Pi, Linux, VNC, streaming, power management, and system integration — with far less risk.

Why this makes sense: lower risk, actually portable (case, stand), easier power via a power bank, and cheaper when you factor in failure risk. Rough cost compare: my original panel + parts plan ~₹17,000+ with no guarantee. new plan totals ~₹21,668 (~$260) and will work.

I have linked up some new screenshots of things i need now ![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTM4NSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--b1a2bd73c7ab0bbd8598801d04601860acb0f228/image.png)![image](/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTM4NiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--191ed99bb3471f6b040d41a83c54f945df3f7b19/image.png)
